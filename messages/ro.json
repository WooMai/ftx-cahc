Nor is the Ad Hoc Committee counseled by Eversheds an option, as they already agreed to settle their litigation and are now bound to support the debtors.\n\nThe estate is due to recover well over 100% petition date value and instead of accruing the surplus back to customers, the debtors plan to use our assets to pay non-customers and US government regulators instead.\n\nThe judge requires us to formally organize in order for our point of view to be considered in court."
